# PONG

The following controls:

W: Move player 1 paddle up
S: Move player 1 paddle down
UP ARROW: Move player 2

WHY?

This code creates a simple version of Pong, a table tennis-themed arcade video game. The game includes two paddles and a ball. Each player controls a paddle by dragging it vertically across the game's screen's left or right side. Players use their paddles to strike the ball back and forth.

The game was originally developed by Allan Alcorn and released by Atari, Inc. in 1972. Pong was the first commercially successful video game, and it helped establish the video game industry. It was designed as a simple training exercise by Atari founder Nolan Bushnell to familiarize Alcorn with game design. Bushnell based the idea on an electronic ping-pong game included in the Magnavox Odyssey, the world's first home video game console.

The code itself is a good example of some basic game design principles:

Game Loop: The main game loop is a core concept in game design, handling events, updating the game state, and rendering the game.

Collision Detection: It shows a simple way to implement collision detection, an essential part of many video games.

Input Handling: It takes input from the keyboard to control the paddles.

Simple Physics: It implements simple physics for the movement of the ball.

Writing this game encompasses several fundamental aspects of game development helps me understand and implement beginner game design while testing my range of python knowledge.
